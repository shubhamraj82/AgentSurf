# Database types

Derive databse types from the Drizzle schema - never hand-write custom or partial shapes for table rows. Export `typeof table.$inferSelect` (and `$inferInsert` when needed) from `lib/schema.ts` and import it . When a customer needs  only some columns , narrow with `Pick<Row, ...>` / `Omit<Row, ...>` rather than redeclaring a literal type. Don't add an insert type where `db.insert(...).values()` already enforces the shapes.
